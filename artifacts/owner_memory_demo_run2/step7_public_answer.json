  "response": "I don't have specific information on whether to prioritize enterprise customers over SMBs this quarter from the documents you've provided. However, the decision to prioritize enterprise customers over SMBs (Small and Medium-sized Businesses) typically depends on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Strategic Goals:** If your company's strategic goals for the quarter include expanding market share in the enterprise segment or focusing on higher-value contracts, prioritizing enterprise customers might be beneficial.\n\n2. **Resource Allocation:** Enterprise deals often require more resources and longer sales cycles but can result in larger contracts. If your company has the resources to support these deals, it might make sense to prioritize them.\n\n3. **Market Conditions:** Current market conditions and trends can also influence this decision. For example, if there's a growing demand for your product or service within the SMB segment, it might be worth focusing on this area.\n\n4. **Product Fit:** Consider where your product or service fits best. If your offerings are more tailored to the needs of enterprise customers, focusing on this segment could lead to better success rates.\n\n5. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Evaluate the CLV of enterprise vs. SMB customers. Enterprises often have a higher CLV, but SMBs can collectively contribute significantly to revenue and might be quicker to close.\n\n6. **Competitive Landscape:** Analyze what your competitors are doing. If they are focusing on SMBs, there might be an opportunity to capture more of the enterprise market, or vice versa.\n\nIt's important to weigh these factors and consider your company's unique situation before making a decision. Consulting with your sales, marketing, and product teams can also provide valuable insights into which segment to prioritize.",
