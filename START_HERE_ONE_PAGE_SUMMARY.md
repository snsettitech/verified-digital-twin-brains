## 🎯 5 Golden Rules (Prevent 90% of Bugs)

```
1️⃣ Check tenant_id filter in every query
2️⃣ Use Depends(get_current_user) for auth
3️⃣ Call verify_owner() after auth check
4️⃣ Enable RLS on new tables
5️⃣ Import supabase from modules.observability (singleton)
```

## 🚀 The Next Step

```
YOU: "Do we implement this?"
ME: "Yes. No research needed. Everything is documented.
     16 hours setup → 3-5x speedup by week 2.
     Pick start here, start today."

YOU: "Sounds good. How do I begin?"
ME: "Read MASTER_MCPS_AND_COMPOUND_ENGINEERING_SUMMARY.md
     (10 minutes). Then pick one of 3 paths and execute."

YOU: "What's the risk?"
ME: "None. Falls back gracefully. Worst case: you get pattern
     index and learning system even without MCPs."

YOU: "Let's go."
ME: "Perfect. See you in 3 months when you're 75% faster."
